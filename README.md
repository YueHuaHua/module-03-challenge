## Description

Simple, clean and responsive html portfolio page showing all my work and knowledge acquired thus far, technologies used, as well as links to different media accounts and a downloadable resume. The page was made with bootstrap as the front-end and consists of author's background description, project experience, and contact information. More information regarding projects completed will be added in time.
